This file provides a class that can be ''trained'' on training data, and then produce new
aggregate features for both training and test data. ''Training'' this class simply consists
of it memorizing various statistics.

Features constructed by this class are primarily inspired by:

"A data mining based system for credit-card fraud detection in e-tail", by
Nuno Carneiro, Gonçalo Figueira, Miguel Costa [1]

"Feature engineering strategies for credit card fraud detection", by
Alejandro Correa Bahnsen, Djamila Aouada, Aleksandar Stojanovic, Björn Ottersten [2]

Implementation is partially based on https://github.com/kb211/Fraud_Detection2017 [3]

        The two features below are inspired by [1]. The paper describes clustering countries in four groups

        risk'' group regardless of the actual ratio within that small sample size. No further information is

        not we consider the sample size to be sufficient. Completely linear Machine Learning models (such as
        pure Logistic Regression) may struggle to combine these two features in an intelligent manner, but
        more hierarchical models (like Neural Networks or Decision Trees) might be able to combine them a bit better.
