# Features

This folder contains code for feature engineering. The overall goal of code in this folder is to create useful (informative) features, based on the raw features in original data
and/or data generated by the simulator. These raw features are typically not directly useful for predictive Machine Learning models, but they can be combined to construct new, more
informative features.
